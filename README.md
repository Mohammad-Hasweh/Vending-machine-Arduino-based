# Vending Machine - Arduino-based


![Vending Machine Prototype](Vending-machine-Arduino-based/vending-machine.PNG)

This project is a custom-built vending machine using an Arduino Uno, integrating various components for coin detection, dispensing, and sorting. It was part of an academic course at my university.

## Components Used:
- **Arduino Uno**
- **5 Servos** – For dispensing items
- **Keypad** – User input for selecting items
- **LCD Screen** – Displays item choices and pricing
- **2 Infrared Sensors** (2 transmitters, 2 receivers) – To detect coin diameter and speed
- **Weight Sensors** – To measure the coin's weight
- **Optional Hall Effect Sensor** – Can be added for magnetic detection of coins

## Features:
- **Coin Detection**: Infrared sensors measure the coin’s diameter and speed as it passes through the machine.
- **Weight Verification**: Weight sensors check if the coin matches the expected value based on its weight.
- **Coin Sorting**: Coins are sorted into the correct bin or returned based on the detected parameters.
- **CAD Design**: Custom CAD files for the machine's structure were designed from scratch.

This project demonstrates a combination of mechanical design, embedded systems, and sensor integration to create a functional vending machine prototype.

## Demonstration:
- Here is a video that shows how the machine works:
